# omz-take
This is a function separated from the [oh my zsh library](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)

It provides three main features:

1. If given a path it will create a new directory (and parent directories) and `cd` into it.
2. If given a remote git url it will clone the repo and `cd` into it.
3. If given a link to an archive `take` will fetch and extract it.

For more detail this is a nice [article](https://batsov.com/articles/2022/09/16/oh-my-zsh-fun-with-take) on the function
# Zap Installation:
